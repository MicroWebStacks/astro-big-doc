A Short reference is a Tag using the SID or Short ID which is a hash from the UID.

Every document has a UID and SID, as well as every asset has a UID and SID.

The SID is unique and fixed, as a hash, only changes if the UID change, and is not affected by the asset content modification (e.g. change new version of the image)
