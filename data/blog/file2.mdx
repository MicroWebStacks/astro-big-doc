# Mardown Static vs Dynamic
By default, astro components cannot be used on an `.md` file unless it is treated like `.mdx`.

## Remark Plantuml Svg (Static)
This code is using `plantumlsvg` code. The remark plugin associated with it is `remark-plantuml-svg`, it directly replaces the code block with an svg content. which is loaded at the same time with the page content.

```plantumlsvg
@startuml
participant Participant as Foo
boundary    Reception    as Foo1
Foo -> Foo1 : Message(Hi there)
@enduml
```


## Remark Plantuml Object (Dynamic)
This code is using `plantumlobj` code. The remark plugin associated with it is `remark-plantuml-object`, it encodes the sequence and places it on the url of an object of type svg. After the user loads the page, the url will be fetcehd from the plantuml server by the client and rendered afterwards which can cause a delay on first load.

```plantumlobj
@startuml
participant Participant as Foo
boundary    Reception    as Foo1
Foo -> Foo1 : Message(Hi there)
@enduml
```
