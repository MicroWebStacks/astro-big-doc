# astro big doc

Live demo : https://microwebstacks.github.io/astro-big-doc/

Astro Theme for big documentation websites. A pure standard Markdown renderer with zero config. 

Hierarchical pages menu from files structure and table of content, Markdown rendered as CMS with Astro components for panzoom, 3D, links, interactive tables, diagrams from code, VSCode like highlighter.

Enhances native markdown '.md' files with Astro components, enables parsing of content from a configurable directory in the file system, and allows relative assets paths usage.

User friendly side menus collapsible and width adjustable with the mouse.

## Features
- Render standard markdown .md with custom Astro components
- Panzoom and Modal on Markdown images
  - URL params auto open Modal
  - URL params text focus : move to, zoom, then animate glow text (supports xhtml SVG foreign objects)
  - URL params updated with pan/zoom and restored from the URL
- Markdown image directive for centering and image size defintion
- Markdown image galleries
  - SVG images gallery with open close expand
  - Photoswipe gallery with transition open
- Markdown tables become interactive with data tables with [DataTables](https://datatables.net/)
  - from Markdown table
  - from xlsx file link
- Markdown Code blocks
  - VSCode like highlighting using [Shikiji](https://github.com/antfu/shikiji)
  - code copy button
- Markdown diagrams rendering
  - from code block
  - from code file link
  - swap between diagram and highlighted code
  - support text to diagram with plantuml, and all formats supported by [kroki](https://kroki.io/)
- Markdown 3D Model viewer
  - from .glb link
  - from yaml code block parameters
- Markdown Note aside (Note, Tip, Caution, Danger)
- Markdown Details collapse block
- Markdown assets 
  - relative assets referencing with zero copy in dev
  - absolute assets referencing from content root and from a public folder (with auto detection)
- Markdown external links identification and rendering with an arrow
- Meta data can be provided in a yaml file to make the SVG interactive with
  - links : a list of `{label,link}` to add links to SVG text matches
  - highlights : a list of `{label,highlights[]}`, for each label hover, a corresponding list of text gets highlighted with font color and weight
- Meta data yaml file can be added to
  - An SVG diagram by placing a yaml file with the same name e.g. for `diagram.svg` a `diagram.yaml`
  - A code link and then simply the same as the code filename e.g. for `diagram.puml` a `diagram.yaml`
  - A code block by using the code block first param e.g. for ```` ```plantuml filename```` a `filename.yaml`

## Environment variables
This project uses unified environment variables that can be configured in a `.env` file, see `.env.example`. All variables will be captured in a `config` structure exported from `config.js` and then used in `astro.config.mjs`, in the express `server.js` and can be imported from any file. A `client_config.js` exports variables that can be used by client code e.g. `PUBLIC_BASE`.

* `OUT_DIR` : directory where the build will be genrated, defaults to `dist`
* `PUBLIC_BASE` : base url for the website, defaults to ""
* `CONTENT` : input directory for the markdown content, defaults to `content`
* `STRUCTURE` : output directory markdown parser content-structure, defaults to `.structure`
* `KROKI_SERVER` : supports local kroki server, defaults to https://kroki.io
## Markdown content
* `icons.yaml` can contain an icon with a link to be placed on the App bar right side
* `url_type` will be automatically defined to `dir` or `file` so that e.g. `./example/readme.md` as type `dir` will be served on `/example`
* `readme.md` or `REAMDME.md` on the content root will be considered as home page served on url root `/`
* markdown front-matter
  * `title` : will be used for the menu as well as a browser page title. For url_type file, the title can also derive the slug, but not for url_type folder.
  *  `slug` : if not available, a slug can be derived from the title of file name. Slug is unused in url_type folder to keep child pages paths similar in file system and url.
  * `order` : defines the menu order of the pages

## Express js Server
Express js server in `server\server.js` can optionally be used to serve the generated static site. It adds an authentication layer on top using Express js passport.

* `PORT` : used for the express server and also needed by the auth callback when auth is enabled, defaults to `3001`
* `HOST` : used for the express server and also needed by the auth callback when auth is enabled, defaults to `0.0.0.0` to listen on all interfaces when no auth is enabled
* `PROTOCOL` : either of http or https, defaults to `http`
* `ENABLE_AUTH` : activates the express atuhentication router, not enabled when not defined
* `ENABLE_CORS` : allows cross origns resource sharing, if you want other websites to use your APIs, not allowed when not defined
* `CERT_FILE` : ssl certificate file path, required when https is used
* `KEY_FILE` : key file for the ssl certificate, required when https is used
* `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`      : Express passport Github strategy configuration
* `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`  : Express passport Github strategy configuration
* `SESSION_SECRET`        : used by 'express-session' handler

# Developper guide
## Ideas
- PanZoom
  - URL params, multiple hits counter
- favicon support different icon types (.svg, .ico, .png) and allow it in content root
- watch and regenerate .structure on save for modified files only
- menus
  - ToC with content type icons (table, diagram, code,...) with filter
  - pages types and icons
  - store menu scroll position
  - store menus width
  - use view transition to give menu persistence impression on page navigation
  - ToC auto-expand : open scroll spy, close all others
  - Left and right : min (disabled) or expand to level slider or selector
  - Left and right : auto expand depth adjust to available vertical space (all level or nothing)
  - open close side on nav-resize click

- Code
  - keep separate plantuml and kroki (due to perf reason)
- check potential replacement of scrollspy with intersection Observer API
  - enhance intersection to cover a path of all visible sections from the page in the toc : start heading, stop heading

- sync with Astro utilities for url resolution and astro image integration
- light and dark mode toggle

- Gallery
  - dynamic adjust on container resize
  - scale items
  - for SVG table of images, use thumbnails to avoid double hits on search
  - click opens original SVG for pan zoom in Modal
- content Structure
  - parse yaml tags and orgnaize menu with tags order hierarchy
- caching
  - SSR render on page hash condition, using ETag
  - page hash with depndencies hashes, include assets hash as attribute
## assets management
* User content can be placed in a configurable relative path to the repo root usually `./content` set in these variables
  * config.content_path
  * config.collect_content.contentdir
* Zerop copy assets management
  * during dev, an API endpoint exposes `./content/*` under `/assets/*`
* Generated content by pages frontmatter (e.g. svg diagrams from code and text code for highlighter client copy) :
  * `./public/codes/*` during dev, served under `/codes/*` with `./src/pages/codes/[...path].js`
  * `./dist/codes` during build, served under `/codes/*`
  * Note : since Astro4/Vite5 `./public/*` does not watch and serve newly generated content by pages frontmatter, that's why an endpoint API is needed
* Generated content by integrations
  * if only needed by the integration or pages build then gets generated in `.structure/` folder (e.g.`documents_list.json`,...)
  * the menu needed by the client gets generated in config.collect_content.out_menu `./public/menu.json` for both dev and build served on `/menu.json`
    * Note : integrations cannot directly generate on `dist` because they cannot persist there before start of build

## Notes
- SVGs
  - if missing viewbox canot be resized
  - should not have `preserveAspectRatio="none"`
- menu config allows index pages but do not use them to keep consistent nav menu of folders/items
- adding interactive SVGs that can be styled with css is challenging
  - `svg.astro` uses the innerHTML fragment which breaks visibility of `style` tag no longer scoping imported SVG
  - import of `rightarrow.astro` still requires style to be either global or inline
  - Tree menu collapse transition :
    - display block/none does not animate the height
    - scaleY does not bring the height down to 0 due to remaining padding margin
    - height can be animated but must be set initially
    - max-height can be animated but must be set to max value which breaks the transition timing
    - max-height adjusting with js requires high complexity depending on state of expanded children hierarchy
    - clip also needs defined start stop
    - flex can also animate but then the flex container height must be set explicitely

# content-structure Development
for development of content-structure it is possible to replace the registry version with the submodule version
```json
  "content-structure": "file:packages/content-structure",
```

- using self signed keys with `server/create.sh` result in browser warning 'your connection is not private' (NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID)
- for 'Let's Encrypt' certificates, ownership has to be proven by visibility of the host from the public internet which makes it not usable for internal domains and local network hosts
